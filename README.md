## API Integration

### Search API
- **Endpoint**: `https://api.tbp.travel/flights` (mocked)
- **Method**: POST
- **Payload**:
  \`\`\`json
  {
    "origin": "DAC",
    "destination": "DXB", 
    "departureDate": "12 Oct 2025",
    "returnDate": "20 Aug 2025",
    "passenger": {
      "adult": 2,
      "children": 0,
      "infant": 0
    }
  }
  \`\`\`

### Authentication
- using mock Firebase authentication


## Key Features Explained

### 1. Dynamic Form Generation
The booking page automatically generates passenger forms based on the search criteria:
- Adult forms include passport number (required)
- Child forms have optional passport fields
- Infant forms have minimal required fields

### 2. State Management
Redux Toolkit manages three main slices:
- **Auth**: User authentication state
- **Search**: Flight search results and parameters
- **Booking**: Booking process and passenger data

### 3. Route Protection
Middleware protects booking routes:
- Redirects unauthenticated users to login
- Preserves intended destination after login
- Sets authentication cookies

### 4. Ticket Download
After successful booking:
- Generates booking reference
- Creates downloadable JSON ticket
- Includes all booking details and passenger info
